# File Download ASP.NET Core Application

This is an ASP.NET Core application that demonstrates how to display a list of files and provide options for downloading individual files or all files as a ZIP archive.

## Features

- **File List**: Displays a list of files with a download button for each file.
- **Download Single File**: Allows users to download individual files.
- **Download All Files**: Provides an option to download all files as a single ZIP archive with a timestamped filename.

## Prerequisites

- [.NET 8.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0)
- A web browser for accessing the application.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/theinhtay-coding/FileDownLoadDemo.git
   cd FileDownLoadDemo

Transfer-Encoding: Chunked
Transfer-Encoding: chunked is a feature in HTTP/1.1 that allows a server to send response data in chunks rather than sending it all at once. Here are some key reasons to use chunked transfer encoding:

Unknown Content Length
When the server cannot determine the full size of the content at the time the response headers are being sent (e.g., the content is generated on-the-fly), chunked encoding allows the server to start sending the response immediately without having to wait for the entire content to be ready.

Memory Efficiency
Instead of loading the entire response content into memory before sending it, the server can send it in smaller, more manageable chunks. This is particularly useful for handling large files or streaming data, as it reduces memory consumption and can handle data more efficiently.

Latency Reduction
By starting to send data as soon as it becomes available, chunked transfer encoding can reduce latency, providing the client with data more quickly. This can lead to a better user experience, especially in applications where data is generated dynamically.

Persistent Connections
Chunked transfer encoding allows the server to maintain the connection open for further communication after the response is complete. This is beneficial for HTTP keep-alive and persistent connections, improving the efficiency of subsequent requests and reducing the overhead of establishing new connections.
