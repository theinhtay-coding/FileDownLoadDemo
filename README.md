# File Download ASP.NET Core Application

This is an ASP.NET Core application that demonstrates how to display a list of files and provide options for downloading individual files or all files as a ZIP archive.

## Features

- **File List**: Displays a list of files with a download button for each file.
- **Download Single File**: Allows users to download individual files.
- **Download All Files**: Provides an option to download all files as a single ZIP archive with a timestamped filename.

## Prerequisites

- [.NET 8.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0)
- A web browser for accessing the application.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/theinhtay-coding/FileDownLoadDemo.git
   cd FileDownLoadDemo

# Transfer-Encoding: Chunked

`Transfer-Encoding: chunked` is a feature in HTTP/1.1 that allows a server to send response data in chunks rather than sending it all at once. Here are some key reasons to use chunked transfer encoding:

## Unknown Content Length

When the server cannot determine the full size of the content at the time the response headers are being sent (e.g., the content is generated on-the-fly), chunked encoding allows the server to start sending the response immediately without having to wait for the entire content to be ready.

## Memory Efficiency

Instead of loading the entire response content into memory before sending it, the server can send it in smaller, more manageable chunks. This is particularly useful for handling large files or streaming data, as it reduces memory consumption and can handle data more efficiently.

## Latency Reduction

By starting to send data as soon as it becomes available, chunked transfer encoding can reduce latency, providing the client with data more quickly. This can lead to a better user experience, especially in applications where data is generated dynamically.

## Persistent Connections

Chunked transfer encoding allows the server to maintain the connection open for further communication after the response is complete. This is beneficial for HTTP keep-alive and persistent connections, improving the efficiency of subsequent requests and reducing the overhead of establishing new connections.



# HTTP Headers Explained

## Cache-Control

The `Cache-Control` header specifies caching directives for both requests and responses.

- **`no-cache`**: Forces revalidation of the response with the origin server before using it.
- **`no-store`**: Directs browsers and caches not to store any part of the response.

## Pragma

The `Pragma` header is used for backward compatibility with HTTP/1.0 clients.

- **`no-cache`**: Similar to `Cache-Control: no-cache`. It is included for older HTTP/1.0 clients.

## Strict-Transport-Security

The `Strict-Transport-Security` header enhances security by enforcing the use of HTTPS.

- **`max-age=31536000`**: Instructs browsers to access the site using HTTPS for the next year (31536000 seconds).
- **`includeSubDomains`**: Applies this rule to all subdomains of the site.

## Via

The `Via` header indicates intermediate proxies that the request or response has passed through.

- **Example Values**:
  - `HTTP/1.1 Inner_Proxy_WK`
  - `HTTP/1.1 Outer_Proxy_WK`

  These values represent the proxies that handled the request. This header is useful for debugging and logging.

## X-Content-Type-Options

The `X-Content-Type-Options` header prevents browsers from interpreting files as a different MIME type.

- **`nosniff`**: Instructs browsers to adhere to the MIME type declared by the `Content-Type` header and not to "sniff" or guess the type.

## X-Nom-Cp-Id

The `X-Nom-Cp-Id` header is a custom header, potentially used for identifying the application or environment.

- **Example Value**: `WM/ePlatform` (This value could be specific to your organization or application.)

## X-Xss-Protection

The `X-Xss-Protection` header provides protection against cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

- **`1; mode=block`**: Enables XSS filtering in supported browsers and prevents the rendering of the page if an attack is detected.
